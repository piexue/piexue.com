> [KouSun | 蔻隼](https://kousun.com) aims to build a **multi-language** CMS(Content Management System) based on **Rust Web stacks**, with long-term upgrade and maintenance.

[Demo site - kids.kousun.com](https://kids.kousun.com) is based on Scratch & Rust web stacks. Kids can create stories, games, musics, arts, animations, tutorials ... and share with others. A gift for my daughter, also hopes to help all kids who enjoy programming.
